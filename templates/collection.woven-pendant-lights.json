Below are some considerations to help you find the best gorgeous pieces for your space.</p>\n\n    <p>The first consideration is the size of the space you are wanting to light and the feeling that you are trying to create. Large woven lights will have a more intense light effect than small ones, so they will be suitable for spacious spaces. Hanging a pendant close to the ceiling will produce the most light, whereas placing it lower gives more of a spotlight effect.</p>\n\n    <p>The second thing you need to consider is the actual size and dimensions of the space. As a general rule, the larger the space or the area needed, the larger the pendant is. Large woven lights suit the spaces that are open-plan and have high ceilings. In contrast, for those that are smaller and have low ceilings, shorter and smaller pendants could be a better choice.</p>\n    \n    <h2><strong>Ideal locations for hanging woven pendant lights</strong></h2>\n    \n    <p>Each type of woven pendant light works well in different contexts. Therefore, before hanging <strong>woven pendant light</strong>s, let’s consider some ideal locations below.</p>\n    \n    <h3><strong>Over a kitchen island</strong></h3>\n\n    <pWoven light fixtures are excellent items to style the hub of your home thanks to their rustic elegance.Large lights might be suitable for such a large open-plan space. One consideration is not to hang these pendants too low to interrupt your view of a nearby dining or lounge area.</p>\n\n    <h3><strong>Above your dining table</strong></h3>\n\n    <p>Hanging a <em>pendant light</em> above a dining table is an excellent way to create an intimate mood for dining. The height of your ceiling is the key element to determine your type of light. If your ceiling is tall, a large pendant is a better option. Additionally, you can consider hanging them a little lower to create a feeling of closeness.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/8576/5122/files/hang-woven-pendant-lights-above-the-dining-table-creates-cozy-atmosphere.jpg?v=1692162247\" alt=\"creates cozy atmosphere\"><br /><em>Hang woven pendant lights above the dining table creates cozy atmosphere</em></p>\n\n    <h3><strong>At the entryway or stairwell</strong></h3>\n\n    <p>A woven light shade will help add more light to an entryway or stairwell and instantly make people feel welcome. The warm glow on the wall from the top and bottom of its woven layers will be a highlight for your home.</p>\n    \n    <h3><strong> In your living room</strong></h3>\n    \n    <p><strong>Woven pendant lights</strong> with warm and dappled glow can set a relaxed tone for your living room. It is perfect to gather, lounge, read and share with family members in a warm and gentle space. Furthermore, they will be gorgeous decorative items that light up your space.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/8576/5122/files/woven-pendant-lights-fully-match-your-living-room.jpg?v=1692162247\" alt=\"fully match your living room\"><br /><em>Woven pendant lights fully match your living room</em></p>\n    \n    <h3><strong>In the hallway</strong></h3>\n\n    <p>Positioning a pendant light in hallways will help to add warmth due to these spaces often lacking these elements. If the size does not permit, small lights are a suitable choice. The lovely pattern of light will create a dramatic, yet subtle effect that feels nourishing at night time.</p>\n\n    <h3><strong>Outdoor dining space</strong></h3>\n\n    <p><strong>Woven pendant lights </strong>are an excellent option to create a warm outdoor space for gathering with family and friends. The thing to remember is pendants easily alter the natural fibers due to wet weather, strong winds, and harsh sunlight over time. Therefore, you need to ensure that the area is fully covered and shielded from these natural elements.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/8576/5122/files/woven-pendant-lights-create-a-warm-outdoor-dining-space.jpg?v=1692162247\" alt=\"create a warm outdoor dining space\"><br /><em>Woven pendant lights create a warm outdoor dining space</em></p>\n\n    <h2><strong>Rowabi - The best option to buy pendant lights</strong></h2>\n\n    <p>A large number of pendant light stores might pose a big challenge for any customers.
