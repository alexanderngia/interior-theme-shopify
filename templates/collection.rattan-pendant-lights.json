If you don’t know where to begin to choose the right one for your space, let's take a few minutes to dive into some tips below.</p>\n    <h3><strong>Determine your style</strong></h3>\n    <p>One of the crucial considerations is determining the style you want to hang your rattan pendant lights are suitable for most styles, from beachy bohemian to modern Scandinavian. However, before you make the final decision, you need to consider what style you want to select the best light that fixes your room design.</p>\n    <h3><strong>Size and scale</strong></h3>\n    <p>You must take size and scale into account when purchasing pendant lights. Small spaces in your home, such as an inviting reading area or bedroom, will feel warmer with a small rattan pendant light. A huge, dramatic pendant light, however, will be a wonderful focal point for a roomy dining or living space.</p>\n\n    <p>In addition, the height at which you hang your pendant lights also has a great impact on the overall feel of the room. A small tip is that hanging the light at different heights can create a dynamic, layered look for your spaces.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/8576/5122/files/small-lights-are-perfect-for-small-spaces.jpg\" alt=\"perfect for small spaces\"><br /><em>Small lights are perfect for small spaces</em></p>\n    <h3><strong>Lighting requirements</strong></h3>\n    <p>Customers do not need to hardwire pendant lighting into the wall to install it. For everyone, the installation process is fairly straightforward. You may install the lamp without damaging the wall above or behind it as long as you have a wall outlet.</p>\n    <h3><strong>Quality of the rattan</strong></h3>\n    <p>It is important to consider the quality of rattan before making a decision. Most <strong>rattan pendant lights </strong>are made up of eco-friendly materials that might be affected by natural elements such as sunlight, wind, rain, etc. Therefore, choosing a rattan light with high quality is vital, especially if you hang it in outdoor spaces. High-quality lights last over time, so they are considered a cost-effective way.</p>\n\n    <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/8576/5122/files/the-quality-of-the-rattan-is-a-vital-consideration-before-purchasing-the-light.jpg\" alt=\"quality of the rattan is a vital consideration\"><br /><em>The quality of the rattan is a vital consideration before purchasing the light </em></p>\n    <h3><strong>Light source compatibility</strong></h3>\n    <p>Light source compatibility is also vital because each bulb features different electricity voltage power. Selecting suitable lights is the best approach to protect yourself and your family.
