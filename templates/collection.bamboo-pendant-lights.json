Make sure the fabric is only slightly damp to avoid excessive moisture that can damage the bamboo material. This will effectively remove any remaining stains or stains.</li>\n        <li><strong>Frequent dust: </strong>Rattan lamps tend to collect dust on the surface easily. So, the best way to clean them is to use a vacuum cleaner with a broom to gently suck the dust from the outside to the inside. In addition, you can also use a soft brush to remove dust and do this regularly to prevent dust from accumulating.</li>\n        <li><strong>Avoid direct sunlight: </strong>Direct sunlight can dry out the lamp and cause the rattan material to fade over time. Therefore, you should place pendant lights away from windows or any other space that gets too much sunlight.</li>\n        <li><strong>Keep lights away from fire and heat sources:</strong> You must ensure that your bamboo pendant light is not used to create flames or direct heat sources. This can cause the bamboo to deform, crack or even break. Therefore, you should keep them at a safe distance from heaters, stoves, or any other heat-generating appliance.</li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <h2><strong>Best products of bamboo pendant lights at Rowabi </strong></h2>\n    \n    <p>At Rowabi, there is a collection of exquisite bamboo lights that elevate the style and ambiance of any space.
